# Pokeeman
i made this for APCSP. I got a 4 :3 
<br>
basically it's very simple pokemon-style but in java with no graphics and through a UI built via javaswing with buttons and text only
<br>
you can:
<br>
-select which pokeeman you want to use
<br>
-see the pokeeman's bios and health
<br>
-fight other pokeeman to catch them
<br>
-run away like a little baby
<br>
-leave the game and see what you accomplished
