# Pokeeman
i made this for APCSP  i turned this in for a grade to the College Board. I got a 4 :3 

basically it's very simple pokemon-style but in java 

you can:
-select which pokeeman you want to use
-see the pokeeman's bios and health
-fight other pokeeman to catch them
-run away like a little baby
-leave the game and see what you accomplished
