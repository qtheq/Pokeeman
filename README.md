# Pokeeman
i made this for APCSP  i turned this in for a grade to the College Board i still can't comprehend that. I got a 4 though. 

basically it's very simple pokemon but in java and badly made. 

you can:
-select which pokeeman you want to use
-see the pokeeman's bios and health
-cry
-fight other pokeeman to catch them
-run away like a little baby
-leave the game and see what you accomplished
-that's it
-that's literally the game
